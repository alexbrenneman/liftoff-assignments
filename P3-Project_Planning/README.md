## Submission Instructions

### Wireframes

(Include at least 3 wireframes here, adding images or files to your the repository as necessary. Format them as a bulleted/unordered list with links to the files.)
<ul>
    <li>The home page will have a basic nav bar on top. It will have info on what ChimTech is and what it can do for the user going down one of the sides. In the center it will have a sign up link that the customer can click and will then be redirected to the sign up page. </li>
    <br>
    <li>The sign up page will also have a basic nav bar. It will have a form that the user will fill out to make a username, a password, they will have to confirm the password, their zip code, and the address which will be optional. Once the form has been submitted it will then redirect the user to the customers own home page.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The customer home page will have a basic nav bar with a logout link. The page will display their submitted info (name, number, zip...). It will also have a map that will be set to show whatever zip the user puts in. The map will also be used when the user searches for service companies. There will be a dropdown box that will have links to the different types of services. At the bottom of the page there is going to be a rating system for users to rate the companies that have done work for them. I will also have a calendar on the page to let the customer put in when they have an upcomming service or to have reminders to find services.</li>
