## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Duriung my time working as a chimney sweep, I noticed some areas that could be made more efficint with technology. The work we did included cleaning, repairs, inspections, and estimating new builds. We had to hand write all of our notes if we were doing inspections and estimates which was not very efficient. The tech would go and get the measurements, write them all down, take pictures of everything on a camera, and try to keep everything organized until he got back the shop at the end of the day. The manager would then have to try to decifer what the tech was trying to say using the hand written (and sometimes hard to read) notes and then uploading all the pictures the tech took.  

The project I am purposing will help make the chimney industry run more efficiently by creating an app that will have all the tools needed for normal day to day tasks. 
It will eventually be an app on the technicians phone that will be connected to a main database operated by the companies. The technicians will be able to take notes, pictures, and videos and automatically have them upoaded into the customers file so that the managers can then be more organized and efficent. This applicaton could also help with routing all the technicians via Google maps.

### Features
This application will have:
    User sign up/ sign in(admin and technician)
    Add new customers
    Edit existing customers
    Add photos of customers chimneys or fireplaces to customer files
    Google maps of customer locations
    Inspection page with guided spots for measurements(ex. 'chimney height, chimney width'...)
    


### Technologies
Java 
Spring Boot
MySQL
Bootstrap? 
Possibly some JavaScript (React)

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn: 
    How to use APIs with Java 
    How to add photos into a database 
    JavaScript 
    More Bootstrap 
    More about Spring and Spring Boot
